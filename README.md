1. This Tableau project aims to comprehensively analyze housing data encompassing various attributes such as price, size, location, and amenities. Through interactive visualizations and dashboards, we will explore trends in property prices over time, identify factors influencing price variations, and assess the impact of features like waterfront views and property condition on market demand. 
2. Additionally, we'll delve into spatial analysis to uncover geographical patterns and hotspots of real estate activity. The project's insights will aid in understanding housing market dynamics, informing investment decisions, and optimizing marketing strategies.
3. The final deliverable will be an intuitive Tableau dashboard offering stakeholders a holistic view of the housing landscape.
